description: This skill covers all AI generation capabilities available through the `google-genai` Python SDK, including text, image, video generation, and managed RAG (File Search). Use it for any task involving Google AI generation or retrieval-augmented generation tasks, and refer to the specific documentation files for detailed instructions on each type of capability.

# Instructions

This skill covers all AI generation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities available through the `google-genai` Python SDK. Read the appropriate documentation file based on the task.

## Prerequisite — API Key Check (Do This First)

Before executing any task from this skill, you **must** verify the Gemini API key is available:

1. Look for a `.env` file (or `.env.example` if `.env` does not exist) in the project root.
2. Check that the following variable is defined and has a non-empty value:

   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
   ```

3. **If the key is missing or empty, STOP immediately.** Do not proceed with any code generation. Instead, ask the user:

   > "I need a Gemini API key to continue. Please add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to your `.env` file (you can get one from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). Once it's set, let me know and I'll continue."

4. Once the key is confirmed present, **always** load it from the environment — never hardcode it:

   ```python
   import os
   from google import genai

   client = genai.Client(api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"])
   ```

   If the project uses `python-dotenv`, load the `.env` file first:

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()
   ```

> **Never** pass a raw API key string in code. The key must come from an environment variable loaded at runtime. This applies to all code examples in GEMINI_DOCS.md, BANANA.md, VEO_DOCS.md, and FILE_SEARCH.md — override any hardcoded `"YOUR_API_KEY"` placeholders with `os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"]`.
